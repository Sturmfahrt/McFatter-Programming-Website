    <p>Java Development & Programming includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Fundamentals of Programming & Software Development</li>
      <li>Procedural & Object-Oriented Programming</li>
      <li>Creating Regular & Specialized Applications Using the JAVA Programming Language including testing, monitoring, debugging, documenting, and maintaining Java computer applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Java Programming prepares individuals to create, monitor, and maintain computer programs and enterprise websites. Students will learn how to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. They will have plenty of time at home and in class to learn these languages
      along with being able to learn other languages on their own. After successfully completing this program, the student will be able to perform advanced business computer programming techniques in game development.</p>
    <p>The student will also have developed skills in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematical Applications</li>
      <li>Computer Literacy</li>
      <li>Communications</li>
      <li>Human Relations</li>
      <li>Job Readiness & Career Development Activities</li>
      <li>Information Processing Concepts</li>
      <li>Design Programs</li>
      <li>Code Programs</li>
      <li>Test Programs</li>
      <li>Perform Program Maintenance</li>
      <li>Debug Programs</li>
      <li>Identify Functions of Computers & Information Processing</li>

    <h2>How Long Does it Take to Learn how to Code?</h2>
    <p>The amount of time it takes to learn how to code is all depenent on you. The minimum amount of time it could take to be ready to make a basic website could be less than a week. To be decent in knowing what to do could take up to a few months. To fully
      master will take a lifetime since coding is always changing every time we find more ways to use it. So once you learn everything there is to know a new version of a language could come out. So you'll have to start learning everything that's new
      along with everything you already know, since it could have been changed in some way.</p>
